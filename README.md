Introduction 
Financial academics and practitioner in the relevant fields have all paid special emphasis on 
financial derivative instruments due of its versatility, indeterminacy and two-sidedness.
Just like what Warrant Buffet has once descripted: “In my view, derivatives are financial 
weapon of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially 
lethal.”, derivatives are often pictured as a double-edge sword in the minds of many 
financial industry participant.

Despite abundant studies have been done on the good and bad of derivative instruments, the 
benefit of financial derivative instrument remains controversial. Graham and Rogers (JF, 
2002) find evidence that firms hedge to increase debt capacity and interest deductions. 
Campello et al (JF, 2011), via focusing on creditor’s evaluation of corporate hedging, 
examined the impact of hedging on firm’s external financing costs, investment spending 
and z-score and find hedging reduces the cost of external financing, eases the firm’s 
investment process and thereby renders lower capital expenditure restrictions. Dadalt et al 
(JFM, 2002), by using alternative analyst forecast as a proxy for asymmetric information, 
find improvement of information environment of the relevant firm (improvement on 
asymmetric information on a firm’s earnings), putting it in another phrase, they find 
derivative hedging’s ability to mitigate noises in earning which are not associated with 
firm’s true profit generating ability, as a result market participants are left with a more 
informative picture on firm’s true earning ability as well as the manager’s ability. Smith 
and Stulz (1985) contend that hedging may reduce the contracting costs with senior 
management, other employees, suppliers, and customers.

Moreover, Bartram et al (JFQA, 2011), Nelson et al (JFC, 2005) and Allayannis and 
Weston (RFS,2001) have focused explicitly on relationship between derivative usage and 
firm value. In which, Allayannis and Weston (RFS, 2001) used a relatively smaller sample 
of non-financial firms and solely examining impact of currency derivative usage. Bartram 
et al (JFQA, 2011) with 6888 sample firms and across 42 countries, find strong evidence 
that financial derivative usage could reduce both total and systematic risk, moreover, 
having positive effect on firm value.
